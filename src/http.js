// HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental protocol of the
// World Wide Web. It is an application-layer protocol that governs
// the communication between clients (such as web browsers) and
// servers (web servers) on the internet. HTTP is responsible for the
// exchange of data and resources, enabling the retrieval and manipulation
// of web content.

// Here are some key points to understand about HTTP:

// 1. **Client-Server Model**: HTTP follows a client-server model,
// where the client sends requests to the server, and the server responds
// with the requested data or performs the requested action.

// 2. **Request-Response Cycle**: The communication between the client and
// server happens in a request-response cycle. The client sends an HTTP
// request to the server, which includes the desired action (such as GET,
// POST, PUT, DELETE) and the URL of the requested resource. The server
// processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the
// requested data, along with a status code indicating the outcome of
// the request.

// 3. **Stateless Protocol**: HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means
// that each request-response interaction is independent and does not retain
// any information from previous requests. The server treats each request
// as a new and isolated transaction.

// 4. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: URLs are used to identify resources
// on the web. They consist of a scheme (such as "http://" or "https://"),
// a domain or IP address, and an optional path to the specific resource.

// 5. **HTTP Methods**: HTTP supports various methods for different actions, including:
  //  - GET: Retrieves a resource from the server.
  //  - POST: Sends data to the server to create a new resource.
  //  - PUT: Updates an existing resource on the server.
  //  - DELETE: Removes a resource from the server.
  //  - And more.

// 6. **Headers**: HTTP headers provide additional information about the
// request or response. They include details such as content type, content
// length, caching directives, and more.

// 7. **Status Codes**: HTTP responses include status codes that indicate the
// outcome of the request. Common status codes include 200 (OK),
// 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and many others.

// HTTP forms the foundation of web communication, allowing for the
// retrieval of web pages, images, documents, and other resources.
// It also serves as the basis for modern web APIs, enabling data exchange
// and integration between client-side applications and server-side services.

// Understanding HTTP is crucial for web developers and anyone working with
// web technologies, as it provides the underlying mechanism for browsing
// the internet and interacting with web-based applications.
